 ALU Regex Data Extraction

This project uses regular expressions to extract specific data types from text. The types of data extracted include:

- Email addresses
- URLs
- Phone numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Time formats (12-hour and 24-hour)
- HTML tags
- Hashtags
- Currency amounts

How It Works

The script uses Python's `re` module to match and extract data from text. It applies regular expressions for each type of data and outputs the results.

 Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Nyabondeng/alu_regex-data-extraction-group28.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

Usage

Run the script with any text data you want to analyze. You can modify the `sample_text` variable in the `regex_extraction.py` file to test different inputs.
